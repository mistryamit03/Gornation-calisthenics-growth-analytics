# 🏋️‍♂️ GORNATION Ecommerce Brand Callisthenics Growth Analytics

## 📌 Title
**Marketing & Fulfilment Analytics Dashboard – GORNATION Mock Project**

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To design a **data-driven framework** that simulates GORNATION’s e-commerce operations and demonstrates how **analytics can accelerate growth, optimize marketing spend, forecast inventory, and enhance fulfilment efficiency** for a fitness brand.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
As GORNATION scales globally, data from **Shopify, Ads, and Fulfilment** often exist in silos.  
Without integrated reporting, the brand risks:
- Overspending on campaigns with unclear ROI  
- Stockouts or excess inventory  
- Delivery delays affecting customer satisfaction  
- Missed opportunities to track community retention  

This project showcases how a unified data ecosystem could solve those issues.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
All datasets are **mock and self-generated** to emulate GORNATION’s real-world structure.

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `orders.csv` | Contains transaction-level data (orders, revenue, ad spend, delivery times, etc.) |
| `product_catalog.csv` | Product metadata including COGS, category, weight, and monthly sales velocity |
| `helper_table.csv` | Aggregated funnel data for marketing performance tracking |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Mock data generation

## 🎯 Scope & Objectives
1. Build an **end-to-end mock data pipeline** simulating GORNATION’s marketing, sales, and logistics flow.  
2. Create four integrated dashboards:
   - **Marketing Funnel & ROI** – Measure CAC, ROAS, and profit by channel.  
   - **Inventory & Sales Forecast** – Predict stock needs and identify reorder risks.  
   - **Customer Segments & Retention** – Track new vs. returning customers and repeat purchase rates.  
   - **Fulfillment KPI Dashboard** – Analyse delivery speed, on-time rates, and return reasons.  
3. Translate insights into **business actions** that drive efficiency, profit, and customer loyalty.  

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Improved simulated **ROAS to 3.9**, reducing CAC by **25%** through better channel targeting.  
- **15% reduction in projected stockouts** via inventory forecasting.  
- **Delivery on-time rate improved from 78% to 92%** after simulating fulfilment optimisation.  
- Identified **return spikes in non-EU regions**, guiding packaging and logistics improvements.  

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
This mock project demonstrates how **data analytics can strengthen GORNATION’s growth engine** — uniting marketing, operations, and fulfillment insights in one ecosystem.  
It reflects how I view data: *not as numbers, but as the story of performance, community, and progress.*

## 📘 Business Report & Visual Storytelling

To complement the technical work, I’ve created a **detailed business report** explaining the insights, metrics, and actionable recommendations derived from the dashboard along with a few collaged photos of my personal Calisthenics Journey. Callisthenics is more than a sport to me — it’s a lifestyle built on discipline, progress, and consistency.  To show that my passion is genuine, I’ve included a **photo collage of my personal training journey** towards the end of the report. Please do have a look at it.

This report translates the data into a clear business narrative — showing how analytics can directly enhance GORNATION’s marketing efficiency, operational planning, and fulfillment reliability.
